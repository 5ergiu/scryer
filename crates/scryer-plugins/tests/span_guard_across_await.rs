//! A span guard held across an await poisons the worker thread that entered it.
//!
//! Gate 7 aborted one Scryer process with
//!
//! ```text
//! thread 'tokio-rt-worker' panicked at tracing-subscriber-0.3.23/src/registry/sharded.rs:317:9:
//! assertion `left != right` failed: tried to clone a span (Id(1924145348616)) that already closed
//! ```
//!
//! six seconds after the download-client component ran, on unrelated code. The
//! mechanism is the `Entered` guard the component hosts held across their
//! awaits:
//!
//! 1. `Span::enter()` pushes the raw `Id` onto the *entering* thread's
//!    thread-local `SpanStack` (`sharded.rs`, `Registry::enter`).
//! 2. The task awaits. The guard lives in the future's state, so nothing exits.
//! 3. Tokio's work-stealing resumes the task on another worker. The guard drops
//!    there, and `exit` pops a stack the id was never pushed onto —
//!    `SpanStack::pop` returns `false` *silently* (`registry/stack.rs`).
//!    The first thread keeps the id forever.
//! 4. The span closes; its refcount reaches zero, but the slab slot is not yet
//!    reused.
//! 5. Any later *contextual* span created on the first thread resolves its
//!    parent through `current_span()`, finds the stale id, and calls
//!    `clone_span` on a span whose refcount is already zero. That is the
//!    assertion above.
//!
//! In tracing 0.1 only `EnteredSpan` carries `PhantomNotSend`; the `Entered`
//! returned by `Span::enter()` is `Send`, so nothing stops the future from
//! crossing threads and nothing warns at compile time.
//!
//! These tests drive the sequence deterministically — two real threads, polled
//! by hand, no scheduler luck — and then hold the component hosts to the
//! construction that cannot exhibit it.
